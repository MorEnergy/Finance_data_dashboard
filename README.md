## Introduction

This project showcases my skills in data visualization by creating an interactive dashboard using popular visualization libraries. The dashboard provides an intuitive way to explore and understand complex financial datasets.

## Features

- Fetches financial data using the `yfinance` library.
- Cleans and processes the data to ensure data quality.
- Utilizes various visualization libraries to create interactive and informative plots.
- Implements interactivity and customization options for enhanced data exploration.
- Demonstrates the use of different visualization techniques to gain insights from financial datasets.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/MorEnergy/Finance_Data_Dashboard.git

        cd Finance_Data_Dashboard

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

        python -m venv venv

        source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the required dependencies:
